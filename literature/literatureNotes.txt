methods or techniques for my project.

-Snap Project (snapLink.txt)
    --Description from the about page: "The SNAP library is being actively 
        developed since 2004 and is organically growing as a result of our 
        research pursuits in analysis of large social and information networks.
        Largest network we analyzed so far using the library was the Microsoft 
        Instant Messenger network from 2006 with 240 million nodes and 1.3 
        billion edges."
    --QUESTION: Have they already analyze the Offshore Leaks Database with this
        library?
    --Recommended to me due to visualization properties.
    --Using Snap.py, a SNAP api for Python. Some aspects of the main library is
        written in C++ and is not available from the API.
    --QUESTION: What properties of this library is not available in the Python
        API?
    --General Developer Reference:
        http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/doc/snapdev-ref/
    --"SNAP is written in C++ and optimized for maximum performance and 
        compact graph representation. It easily scales to massive networks with
        hundreds of millions of nodes, and billions of edges."
    --QUESTION: how does it scale? Perhaps I need to look more at a whitepaper
        on its implementation.
    --see ../code/snapTutorial/snapTutorial.py for some note on variable types
