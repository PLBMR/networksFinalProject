For my final project, I will be doing an analysis of the Offshore Leaks
Database. This database shows relationships and networks among people and
companies in offshore entities that are traditionally designated as ``tax
havens''. Thus, to some degree, this database provides strong insights into how
the world's rich conduct offshore business. This database was constructed from
three leaks: the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' (ICIJ)
China Leaks investigation in 2013, the Panama Papers leak in April 2016, and the
Bahamas Leak in September 2016.
