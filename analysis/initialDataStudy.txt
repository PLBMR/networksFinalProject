-Description of the dataset on the website:
    --https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database
    --This database contains information on almost 500,000 offshore entities 
        that are part of the Panama Papers, the Offshore Leaks and the Bahamas 
        Leaks investigations. The data covers nearly 40 years – from 1977 
        through to early 2016 – and links to people and companies in more than 
        200 countries and territories.
    --Data comes from three leaks: The Offshore Leaks (2013), The Panama Papers
        (April 2016), and the Bahamas Leaks (September 2016)
    --Currency:
        ---The Offshore Leaks is current through 2010, the Panama Papers are
            current through 2015, and the Bahamas Leaks are current through
            early 2016.
    --Not everyone in the database has committed a crime, but this does expose
        potential dealings that could be criminal in nature, depending on the
        country
    --"The information contained in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database is just a 
        fraction of the leaked files of the Panama Papers, the Offshore Leaks 
        and the Bahamas Leaks investigations"

        ---History of data collection: https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/data
        ---The database only features a fraction of the Panama Papers, which
            amounted to about 2.6TB (or 11.5 million files) in the raw file
            transfer
        ---"From the 1.3 million files received as part of the Bahamas Leaks 
            investigation, the database was expanded to include the names of 
            directors and some owners of more than 175,000 Bahamian companies,
            trusts and foundations."
